						A recent Mechanical Engineering graduate with a 2:1 honors degree from University of Ilorin. I had my 6 months internship program with R.Odubanjo Street Works Ltd where I gained experience in arc welding and sheet fabrication. I am also a front-end developer currently skilled in markup languages such as HTML and CSS3, bootsrap4 framework and Javascript. My career vision is to work in a challenging environment demanding all my skills and efforts to explore and adapt myself in different fields and realize my potential where I get the opportunity for continuous learning.
